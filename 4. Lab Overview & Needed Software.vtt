00:06.470 --> 00:10.940
As I mentioned this course is going to be highly practical.

00:10.940 --> 00:17.830
Therefore you will need a lab a place where you can practice and experiment with the things that you're

00:17.840 --> 00:20.690
going to learn in the course.

00:20.990 --> 00:28.340
Not only that but having a lab is essential for hackers or pen testers because let's say you discovered

00:28.430 --> 00:34.100
a new attack or you want to experiment with a new attack or you learn something new online and you want

00:34.100 --> 00:34.950
to test it.

00:35.060 --> 00:43.170
Then the perfect place for you to test this and practice hacking is a hacking or a testing lab not to

00:43.170 --> 00:44.190
create a lab.

00:44.190 --> 00:50.390
You just need a number of computers with different operating systems and you will need a number of networks.

00:50.400 --> 00:55.980
If your testing network attacks and if you're testing Web site attacks then you will need to install

00:55.980 --> 01:05.100
Web sites on these computers or you can do all of this inside your computer inside one machine and install

01:05.160 --> 01:08.760
everything else as virtual machines.

01:08.790 --> 01:10.980
And this is what we're going to do.

01:11.070 --> 01:17.010
So let's say you have your computer right here this is your main computer that you use every day to

01:17.010 --> 01:20.530
check your e-mails or even to watch this course.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.570
This computer might be running Windows OSX or Linux.

01:24.570 --> 01:25.770
It doesn't really matter.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.670
It can run any operating system.

01:27.720 --> 01:35.970
You can keep all the programs that you love and like and install a virtualization software such as virtual

01:35.970 --> 01:46.730
box virtualization software allow us to create a number of virtual computers inside your main computer

01:47.030 --> 01:55.610
so we can have three or four or five or 10 computers all installed inside your main operating system

01:55.790 --> 01:58.850
inside your main computer.

01:58.850 --> 02:03.210
The really cool thing about this is you will not need a number of computers.

02:03.260 --> 02:08.010
You can do everything inside a single computer.

02:08.190 --> 02:11.910
So what we're going to do is we're going to have a heart candy machine.

02:11.910 --> 02:17.540
This is going to be the machine that we will use in order to hack into other machines.

02:17.580 --> 02:24.480
We're going to install color Linux on it and we'll talk about what that is later on and we're going

02:24.480 --> 02:26.640
to have to target machines.

02:26.640 --> 02:33.210
These are machines that we're going to try to hack into and practice hacking against one of them is

02:33.210 --> 02:38.640
going to be running windows and the other one is going to be running an operating system called me to

02:38.650 --> 02:42.030
exploit Hubble and we will talk about that once we get to it.

02:43.700 --> 02:50.930
Now it is very important to understand that you will not lose any functionality when you install an

02:50.960 --> 02:53.790
operating system as a virtual machine.

02:53.930 --> 02:59.150
You can use that machine exactly as if it's a real physical machine.

03:00.380 --> 03:07.180
So the really cool thing about using virtual machines first of all you're not going to lose any functionality.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.840
Second all the machines are going to be isolated.

03:10.880 --> 03:16.430
So as we go through the course we're going to be trying to hack into these machines and we might actually

03:16.430 --> 03:19.170
break one of them but that's fine.

03:19.190 --> 03:21.500
It will not affect your host machine.

03:21.560 --> 03:28.580
You will be able to easily fix this and go back to a snapshot of when the machine was working without

03:28.640 --> 03:32.080
affecting your main computer.

03:32.090 --> 03:37.160
The other cool thing is that you'll be able to have a number of different versions of each of these

03:37.160 --> 03:44.390
machines and you'll be able to change the configuration easily change the network settings or switch

03:44.390 --> 03:49.430
between different states of these machines and so on.

03:49.430 --> 03:57.990
So by using virtualization you will not lose any functionality but you will gain so many cool features.

03:58.280 --> 04:04.850
And the main thing to keep in mind is your host machine your main computer will never be affected.

04:04.850 --> 04:06.730
It's completely isolated.

04:06.860 --> 04:14.120
And if we break any of these machines nothing will happen to your precious computer that you use every

04:14.140 --> 04:14.940
day.

04:15.110 --> 04:20.960
And this way you can always use your host machine for daily use for checking emails watching the videos

04:21.200 --> 04:28.270
doing whatever you do normally and then use your virtual machines for hacking and practicing the attacks.

04:28.550 --> 04:29.980
And this is what I actually do.

04:30.230 --> 04:36.080
So you can see I have my host machine running OSX and I never use this for hacking.

04:36.560 --> 04:42.440
But right here I have virtual box and as you can see I have a number of operating systems installed

04:42.440 --> 04:46.870
on it and I can literally start any of them by selecting the one I want.

04:47.060 --> 04:50.950
And just click on Start Now don't worry about this.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.600
I will show you how to install these virtual machines as we go through the course.

04:56.060 --> 05:00.920
But what you need to do right now is download and install virtual box.

05:00.920 --> 05:06.010
This program so you can download it from this page.

05:06.020 --> 05:08.650
I'm going to include its link in the resources.

05:08.870 --> 05:13.790
And like I said you can install virtual bugs on Windows OS X or Linux.

05:13.790 --> 05:16.400
So it supports all operating systems.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.210
Just pick your operating system from here.

05:19.400 --> 05:26.040
Download the relevant installer and install it and install on it is very very simple.

05:26.060 --> 05:31.700
All you have to do is literally double click the installer click Next next next next and it will install

05:31.700 --> 05:33.530
it for you.

05:33.530 --> 05:39.380
Once you started you'll see a program similar to this but you will not have any virtual machines here.

05:39.410 --> 05:46.550
So it will be empty and I will show you how to install all of these machines as we go through the course

05:48.660 --> 05:49.910
one more thing to do.

05:49.950 --> 05:57.470
As soon as you install virtual box is to download and install the extension pack.

05:57.640 --> 06:06.160
This will give you better compatibility and it will allow you to use USP devices on the virtual machines

06:06.280 --> 06:12.690
so you'll be able to use a USB mouse USB keyboard and you SB wireless adapters.

06:12.910 --> 06:17.710
Again downloading and installing the extension pack is very very simple.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.070
There is only one file.

06:19.090 --> 06:22.390
It's always the same file for all operating systems.

06:22.390 --> 06:25.600
It's the same for Windows for Linux for OSX.

06:25.690 --> 06:28.820
You just have to click on the download link in here.

06:30.140 --> 06:36.770
Once you download that I already have it downloaded so I have it right here and this file will only

06:36.770 --> 06:41.130
work if virtual box is installed successfully.

06:41.210 --> 06:44.740
So first of all installed virtual box from these links right here.

06:44.750 --> 06:51.200
Like I said once you download it and install it and can see a Windows similar to this without these

06:51.200 --> 06:58.460
machines right here we'll see how to install these later then download the extension pack from here.

06:58.460 --> 07:06.260
You'll have its file similar to this file and only then you can double click this file and it'll automatically

07:06.290 --> 07:13.770
open in virtual box as you can see it's telling me that I want to install the extension pack.

07:13.870 --> 07:19.570
It's given me the version which is the same version as the Virgin of the virtual box that I downloaded

07:20.020 --> 07:24.490
it has to be the same version otherwise it will not work.

07:24.490 --> 07:26.740
I'm going to click on install.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.270
We're going to agree to this license.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.790
I'm going to put my password

07:38.120 --> 07:43.890
and as you can see it's telling us that the extension pack is installed successfully.

07:43.940 --> 07:48.620
So now we can go ahead and install virtual machines in virtual box.

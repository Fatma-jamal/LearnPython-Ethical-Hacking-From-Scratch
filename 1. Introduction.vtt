00:01.050 --> 00:02.430
Hello and welcome.

00:02.490 --> 00:03.560
My name is Zahed.

00:03.600 --> 00:07.970
I'm an ethical hacker a computer scientist and I'll be your instructor and this course

00:14.490 --> 00:17.040
this course is going to be highly practical.

00:17.130 --> 00:19.160
What it won't neglect the theory.

00:19.410 --> 00:25.380
So we'll start by covering some terminology then I'm going to show you how to install the needed software

00:25.560 --> 00:30.580
in order to write quite some programs and practice hotcake safely.

00:31.770 --> 00:37.770
Throughout the course we're going to learn by example so we'll never have any boring playing program

00:37.770 --> 00:38.700
in lectures.

00:38.700 --> 00:44.910
We will always be building something exciting and I'm going to teach you programming as we build these

00:44.910 --> 00:47.120
exciting programs.

00:47.220 --> 00:51.210
The first program we'll write is a mock changer.

00:51.210 --> 00:56.190
This is a very simple program that can be used to change the MAC address.

00:56.220 --> 01:00.580
Don't worry if you don't know what a MAC address is or why you'd want to change it.

01:00.630 --> 01:03.020
We will cover all of that later on.

01:03.090 --> 01:09.900
Basically the whole point of writing this program is to introduce you to Python basics such as writing

01:09.900 --> 01:16.190
functions variables handling user input projects and so on.

01:16.440 --> 01:23.130
And here you'll learn how to properly model a problem write an algorithm to solve this problem and then

01:23.130 --> 01:27.140
write Python code to implement this solution.

01:27.150 --> 01:32.880
Once we have the basics covered we're going to start writing a little bit more complex programs.

01:33.420 --> 01:39.630
So we'll start with a network scanner which is a program that can discover all clients connected to

01:39.630 --> 01:45.270
the same network and display their IP address and MAC address in here.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.230
I'm going to introduce you to skippy.

01:47.460 --> 01:53.460
And I'm going to teach you how to send and receive our responses and analyze them.

01:53.460 --> 01:59.970
I will also introduce you to dictionaries and lists and will see how to use them and all the operations

01:59.970 --> 02:02.020
that we can invoke on them.

02:02.810 --> 02:05.550
Next we'll dive deeper into networking.

02:05.690 --> 02:09.420
We're going to learn what AARP is what it's used for.

02:09.560 --> 02:17.880
What is AARP proofing and how to write a Python program to run an AARP spoofing attack as we do this.

02:17.900 --> 02:26.540
You'll learn more about K.P. analyzing network layers handling exceptions loops and more that were going

02:26.540 --> 02:29.710
to die even deeper and networking.

02:30.020 --> 02:36.470
So you're going to learn how to sniff data sent or received by any computer connected to the same network

02:36.500 --> 02:37.510
as us.

02:37.520 --> 02:45.560
This means we'll be able to see visited websites logon information passwords and pretty much everything

02:45.590 --> 02:47.590
they do on the internet.

02:48.740 --> 02:55.700
You'll also learn how to analyze data sent in the different layers in each packet and how to modify

02:55.700 --> 02:56.550
the data.

02:57.490 --> 03:04.950
So we will be able to inject code and hasty DML pages loaded by any computer on the same network we'll

03:04.960 --> 03:11.890
be able to replace downloads and even spoof DNS requests to any destination we want.

03:12.750 --> 03:21.690
We'll learn all of this by writing a sniffer a dn a spoof or a code injector on a file interceptor Once

03:21.690 --> 03:28.610
done with all of this will move to a really exciting section where you'll learn how to write malware.

03:28.650 --> 03:35.680
We'll start with writing simple evil programs so programs that can download a file execute code sent

03:35.730 --> 03:42.270
a report by e-mail and then I'm going to show you how to combine all of these programs to suit different

03:42.270 --> 03:49.770
scenarios and execute powerful attacks that we're going to advance into writing more complex malware

03:49.980 --> 03:57.000
and we'll start by writing a back door a back door is a program that gives you full control over the

03:57.000 --> 04:00.470
system that it gets executed on.

04:00.540 --> 04:05.520
We're going to implement this using sockets and you're going to learn how to establish a connection

04:05.730 --> 04:10.390
between two devices and transfer data between them.

04:10.920 --> 04:16.250
This is very useful because it can be used in so many other scenarios other than hacking.

04:16.380 --> 04:23.920
So you can use it to create a web server a chat program and so on then we're going to build more cool

04:23.920 --> 04:30.790
features in this backdoor so that we can use it to execute system commands remotely on the target computer

04:31.030 --> 04:39.340
download and upload files and maintain our access even if the system restarts then we will implement

04:39.340 --> 04:45.970
a key logger which is a program that registers every keystroke entered on the keyboard and send us a

04:45.970 --> 04:49.410
report by e-mail as we do this.

04:49.420 --> 04:55.440
I'm going to teach you about recursive functions threading and object oriented programming.

04:55.690 --> 05:00.850
And the last part of the section I'm going to show you how to package all of the programs that we've

05:00.850 --> 05:08.270
built so far so that they can run on any operating system on Windows OS X and Linux.

05:08.320 --> 05:13.810
Not only that but I'm also going to show you how to convert these programs into Trojans.

05:13.810 --> 05:21.760
So they look and function just like any other file type like an image or a PTF finally will move to

05:21.760 --> 05:27.250
the Web site hacking section where you learn how websites work and how to communicate with Web sites

05:27.250 --> 05:28.480
using Python.

05:28.720 --> 05:35.980
And then we'll build a number of information gathering programs that can be used to discover files directories

05:36.130 --> 05:43.470
and subdomains that were going to write a program that can be used to get the logging information of

05:43.560 --> 05:47.270
any log in page as we do this.

05:47.330 --> 05:54.430
You're going to learn how to read the Hastey code of any web page analyze it and extract the useful

05:54.430 --> 05:55.580
parts from it.

05:57.720 --> 06:02.070
Finally we're going to build a generic vulnerability scanner.

06:02.370 --> 06:09.980
This is a program that takes a website as an input and scans the whole website for weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

06:10.020 --> 06:15.960
Once done it's going to show us a report of all the discoveries and we're going to write this program

06:16.020 --> 06:22.050
in a way so that it can discover any type of vulnerability as we write this.

06:22.080 --> 06:28.050
We're going to learn more about object oriented programming on how to structure your program in a way

06:28.230 --> 06:30.770
so that it can be easily extended.

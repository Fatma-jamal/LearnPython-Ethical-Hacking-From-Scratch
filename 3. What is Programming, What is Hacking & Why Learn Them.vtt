00:01.000 --> 00:05.190
Now as I promised you this course is going to be highly practical.

00:05.320 --> 00:09.030
But I also promise that I will not neglect this hearing.

00:09.430 --> 00:15.320
So I want to cover some terminology before we jump into hocking programming.

00:15.970 --> 00:22.870
Now what we mean by hocking is being able to gain access to a system that you're not supposed to have

00:22.870 --> 00:24.220
access to.

00:24.220 --> 00:30.520
So for example logging into an email account that you're not supposed to have access to is considered

00:30.520 --> 00:32.550
hocking that account.

00:32.920 --> 00:39.100
Gaining access to a remote computer that you're not supposed to have access to is hacking that computer

00:39.520 --> 00:43.510
reading information that you're not supposed to be able to read.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.820
Again it's considered hacking.

00:46.390 --> 00:52.690
So you can see that there is a large number of ways to hack into a system and the word hacking can refer

00:52.690 --> 00:59.980
to a number of things but the main concept is the same gaining access or being able to do things that

00:59.980 --> 01:04.590
you're not supposed to be able to do is considered hacking.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.060
Now there are three main types of hackers.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.830
We have the black hat hackers.

01:08.860 --> 01:15.820
These are the bad people that hack systems illegally in order to steal money or to achieve their own

01:15.950 --> 01:18.040
illegal goals.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.330
The second part of hackers are the white hat hackers.

01:21.340 --> 01:22.910
So this is us.

01:23.080 --> 01:30.550
These people use the same techniques used by black hat hackers and they also hack into systems but they

01:30.550 --> 01:38.830
only hack into systems that they have permission to hack in order to test the security of these systems.

01:38.860 --> 01:42.300
And finally we have the Greatheart hackers.

01:42.340 --> 01:44.530
These are a mixture of the two.

01:44.560 --> 01:50.570
So they will hack into any system even if they don't have permission to test the security of the system.

01:50.830 --> 01:54.430
But they will never steal money or damage that system.

01:54.430 --> 01:59.430
And in most cases they'll go ahead and tell the administrator of that system.

01:59.650 --> 02:06.880
But what they do is still illegal because they test the security of systems that they do not own or

02:06.880 --> 02:09.780
do not have permission to test.

02:09.790 --> 02:15.500
Now one big question that people always ask is why Hartke Why teach or learn hacking.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.030
Well hacking is an existing industry.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.090
There are lots of job opportunities for ethical hackers.

02:21.190 --> 02:26.860
For people like us who will go ahead and test the security of systems to make sure that these systems

02:26.920 --> 02:33.610
are secure and not vulnerable to black hat hackers there is actually a huge demand for ethical hackers

02:33.610 --> 02:38.010
these days because of the increased amount of hacking attacks.

02:38.020 --> 02:43.040
So we on the day the big systems and big companies are getting hacked.

02:43.120 --> 02:50.070
Not so long ago Oberg got hacked and information of more than 56 million users were exposed.

02:50.290 --> 02:57.250
So companies like Obery Facebook and Google they hire hackers in order to try and hack into their systems

02:57.490 --> 03:01.450
and tell them where the weaknesses are so that they can fix it.

03:01.450 --> 03:06.970
They also have about bounty programs where they literally ask all the hackers around the world to go

03:06.970 --> 03:10.360
ahead and try to hack into their websites and their web applications.

03:10.510 --> 03:15.590
And if they could they will pay them a bounty for the box that they find.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.610
Now what's the hacking part covered.

03:17.640 --> 03:22.550
What discourse is not only a hacking course we will also cover programming.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.550
So what do we mean by programming.

03:25.890 --> 03:33.240
Well programming is the process of writing a program and this very definition leads us to the next question.

03:33.270 --> 03:34.700
What is a program.

03:34.980 --> 03:41.030
Well a program is a set of instructions that will allow us to solve a problem.

03:41.100 --> 03:45.110
For example we have the Facebook app or the Facebook website.

03:45.210 --> 03:48.520
And the problem that it solves is social networking.

03:48.540 --> 03:52.090
So it allows us to stay connected with our friends and family.

03:52.590 --> 03:56.110
Another example is your media player such as iTunes.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.440
It solves the problem of clean music for you.

03:59.550 --> 04:07.620
So if you think of it any program that you use solves a certain problem so program it is the process

04:07.680 --> 04:11.330
of writing a program to solve a problem.

04:11.340 --> 04:18.330
Now since this is a hacking and program of course our problem is always going to be trying too hard

04:18.540 --> 04:20.210
into a certain system.

04:20.520 --> 04:26.830
So basically we will be writing programs that will allow us to hack into networks computers Web sites

04:26.970 --> 04:34.670
and so one now the solution for the problem cannot be written in plain English you're going to have

04:34.670 --> 04:38.110
to write it in a language that the computer can understand.

04:38.330 --> 04:41.980
So you're going to have to use a programming language to do that.

04:43.070 --> 04:47.130
Now you can use any programming language to write programs for hacking.

04:47.450 --> 04:51.830
But in this course we're only going to be using Python.

04:51.830 --> 04:58.730
The reason why I think Python because it's a very simple language yet powerful it's open source and

04:58.790 --> 05:05.660
object oriented and it has great libraries that can be used for both for hiking and for writing very

05:05.660 --> 05:09.010
useful normal programs other than hacking programs.

05:10.210 --> 05:14.760
Now the last question that you might think we covered why you'd want to learn hacking.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.150
But why would you want to learn programming.

05:17.410 --> 05:23.560
Well programming is a very very important skill these days everything around us is controlled by computers

05:23.830 --> 05:27.850
and the only way to communicate with computers is to write programs.

05:27.850 --> 05:33.280
Some countries are even starting to teach programming to their school children because they think it

05:33.280 --> 05:37.390
is just as important as learning math on other subjects.

05:37.870 --> 05:43.540
Now since you want to be a hacker or you're interested in hacking then programming is very very important

05:43.540 --> 05:49.120
for you especially because it will allow you to start implementing your own attacks.

05:49.210 --> 05:54.670
So instead of using other tools made by other people you're going to be able to write your own tools

05:54.820 --> 06:00.710
to exploit witnesses that you discover or to carry out attacks that nobody has ever implemented.

06:01.150 --> 06:06.760
Not only that but you're going to have the ability to read programs written by other people and extend

06:06.760 --> 06:13.000
them fix them if they have bugs or extend them to make them fit your situation or your scenario.

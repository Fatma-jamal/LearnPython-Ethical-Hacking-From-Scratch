WEBVTT

00:00.790 --> 00:05.500
Now throughout the course we're going to be using a number of penetration testing tools.

00:05.500 --> 00:11.710
You can go ahead and install each of these tools manually or you can do what most paint testers do including

00:11.710 --> 00:17.880
myself and save time and effort and use an operating system designed for hacking.

00:17.890 --> 00:23.650
We're gonna be using an operating system called Cally Linux and it's just a flavor of linux based on

00:23.650 --> 00:29.170
Debian and it comes in with all the programs and the applications that we need to use pre installed

00:29.410 --> 00:30.720
and reconfigured.

00:30.730 --> 00:36.770
This means that we can just install this operating system and then start learning our hacking.

00:36.790 --> 00:38.870
There are two options to install Carly.

00:38.890 --> 00:44.740
You can install it as a virtual machine inside your current operating system or you can install it as

00:44.740 --> 00:49.920
a main machine as a main operating system throughout the course.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.410
I'm actually going to be using it as a virtual machine because using it as a virtual machine works exactly

00:55.410 --> 01:00.930
the same as installing it as a main machine because it will be completely isolated from your computer

01:00.960 --> 01:03.480
because it's only going to run inside virtual box.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.730
So if you break it or if you mess things up it's very very easy to fix.

01:07.740 --> 01:15.330
It's very easy to go back to other snapshots other configurations and also you won't lose any functionality

01:15.450 --> 01:17.840
by using it as a virtual machine.

01:17.850 --> 01:20.610
That's why I always use it as a virtual machine.

01:20.670 --> 01:26.670
And in this lecture I'm going to cover how to install it as a virtual machine inside virtual box.

01:26.670 --> 01:32.670
Now I'm going to be doing the steps on a Mac OS X computer but these tapes are exactly the same regardless

01:32.730 --> 01:34.680
of what operating system you use.

01:34.680 --> 01:40.140
So if you're on Windows or on Linux you just have to download the virtual box version of your computer

01:40.530 --> 01:44.120
and then the steps shown in this lecture are exactly the same.

01:44.120 --> 01:50.010
After installing virtual bugs so I'm going include the download link and the resources of this lecture

01:50.730 --> 01:53.240
and I have it already opened in here.

01:53.370 --> 01:59.770
All you have to do is just scroll down make sure you click on the calendar next virtual box images not

01:59.770 --> 02:06.240
on the VM where and then download the version of Kali that's compatible with your system.

02:06.270 --> 02:13.230
So if you have a 64 bit computer download the 64 bits if if you have the 32 bits download the 32 bits.

02:13.230 --> 02:16.590
Now one click on this will start to download for you.

02:16.590 --> 02:21.960
If you're using Internet Explorer or Edge browser then you're going to have to right click and save

02:21.960 --> 02:27.000
target us on Chrome and Firefox you can just click the link.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.740
Now this is downloading for me and I'm gonna stop it because I've already downloaded so I already have

02:33.740 --> 02:35.260
a download is in here.

02:35.540 --> 02:42.230
And as you can see you should get a file with a dot over a extension so you have the name followed by

02:42.230 --> 02:44.400
dot a in here.

02:44.780 --> 02:52.610
So to install this in virtual box all you have to do is literally just double click the file and as

02:52.610 --> 02:57.140
you can see I get a window which will allow me to import this virtual machine.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.260
Now I'm going to keep everything the same for now and I'm just going to click on import

03:08.240 --> 03:11.230
now that's it the virtual machine is ready to be used.

03:11.250 --> 03:16.140
Now before I started I want to show you how to modify some of its settings.

03:16.140 --> 03:20.890
So we're going to click on it then we're going to click on the settings in here.

03:20.950 --> 03:27.910
Now depending on the host operating system you're using the layout of virtual box might be slightly

03:27.910 --> 03:31.540
different but using it is exactly the same.

03:32.470 --> 03:35.950
So make sure you follow the steps that I'm going to do right now.

03:36.040 --> 03:43.550
And it should work on all operating systems whether you use Windows Linux or Mark or as x.

03:43.570 --> 03:48.700
So the first thing that I'm going to do I'm going to go to system and I'm going to modify the amount

03:48.700 --> 03:53.800
of RAM it has now dependent on how much total ram you have on your computer.

03:53.800 --> 03:59.400
You can give this at 2 if you want but one gigabyte is enough for candy.

03:59.440 --> 04:05.470
I usually leave it at two because I have 16 gigs of RAM but if you have less one gigabyte is enough

04:05.470 --> 04:12.820
for it also if you come here on the processors you'll see that by default I have two processors assigned

04:12.820 --> 04:13.450
to it.

04:13.630 --> 04:20.570
Again I have ACP use so too is not going to cause too much pressure on my computer.

04:20.590 --> 04:25.270
If you have less one CPA is enough for Carly.

04:25.400 --> 04:30.740
Now we're gonna go to the network settings and we're gonna set this to use a not network

04:33.390 --> 04:35.990
now sometimes when you set this to a not network.

04:36.060 --> 04:39.780
You won't see a network name in here if you don't.

04:39.780 --> 04:45.460
Please check out my link in the resources and it'll show you how to create an ad network.

04:45.690 --> 04:47.450
For me it already has an ad network.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.800
So I'm going to keep it on this one.

04:49.800 --> 04:56.580
And what this setting basically does is it's going to create a virtual network where my host machine

04:56.580 --> 05:03.510
which is my iMac OSX computer in here is going to be the router for this network and then all the virtual

05:03.510 --> 05:09.960
machines are going to be clients connected to this network so they're gonna get Internet connection

05:10.110 --> 05:11.710
from my host machine.

05:11.850 --> 05:16.880
And at the same time all of my virtual machines will be connected to a virtual network.

05:16.890 --> 05:21.860
This is very handy because my virtual machines will be able to communicate with each other.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.200
We can use one of them to hack into the other.

05:24.270 --> 05:31.110
We can use it to test networks attacks and much more so it'll first allow my virtual machines to have

05:31.110 --> 05:32.270
Internet connection.

05:32.280 --> 05:38.340
It will also allow them to communicate with each other and it'll do all of this through a virtual network.

05:38.340 --> 05:42.940
It will not use any of your wireless adapters or any of your wireless cards.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.570
It will create a virtual either net network.

05:45.570 --> 05:51.720
So as far as the virtual machine is concerned they're going to think that they're connected to to a

05:51.720 --> 05:55.200
network through a wire.

05:55.250 --> 06:03.920
Now if you're on Virtual Box 6 and have a screen with high resolution you need to go to display and

06:03.920 --> 06:13.290
set the scale factor to 200 percent because otherwise the virtual machines screen will be too small

06:13.830 --> 06:18.030
but only do this if you have a screen with a high resolution.

06:18.030 --> 06:24.440
And if you're using virtual box six otherwise keep this option the way it is.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.290
Now we're done with this.

06:26.350 --> 06:32.340
I'm going to click on OK and we can start this virtual machine like any other virtual machine.

06:32.350 --> 06:41.020
We just click on it and we click on start.

06:41.050 --> 06:44.410
Now I'm going to click inside the virtual machine and hit enter

06:48.770 --> 06:52.040
and we are inside the virtual machine.

06:52.040 --> 06:58.510
Now if you followed everything that I did so far started calmly and got stuck at a black screen.

06:58.520 --> 07:03.020
So if you did not get the screen that I have right now then don't worry about that.

07:03.260 --> 07:09.290
This is a common issue and I've included a link in the resources of this lecture that shows how to fix

07:09.290 --> 07:10.660
this issue.

07:10.760 --> 07:17.030
You can access the resources of this lecture or any lecture by clicking on the resources icon on the

07:17.030 --> 07:23.290
top left of the player if you follow all of the steps shown in the link and you're still stuck at this

07:23.290 --> 07:30.400
issue or if you're getting a different issue then please post this issue in the Q and A section and

07:30.400 --> 07:35.440
we'll respond to you within 15 hours and help you to fix this issue.

07:35.440 --> 07:43.630
Now it's asking us for the user name and the default user name is Root so our O T and then is asking

07:43.630 --> 07:49.180
us for the password and the default password is the reverse of that which is t o r

07:52.280 --> 07:53.030
and that's it.

07:53.030 --> 07:59.690
Now I'm inside my virtual machine now since we installed this using the ready image we can just go to

07:59.690 --> 08:07.050
view full screen and we'll be able to go in full screen and the screen will resize automatically to

08:07.050 --> 08:08.430
the size of our screen.

08:10.980 --> 08:15.570
Now note in here you see that I have a network icon appearing in here.

08:15.570 --> 08:20.330
And if I click it you'll see it looks like I'm connected to a wired network.

08:20.340 --> 08:23.010
As you can see in here it says wired connected.

08:23.100 --> 08:30.370
So Carly thinks it's connected to a wired network because we set this machine to use and not network.

08:30.390 --> 08:32.490
So if I open my browser in here

08:36.030 --> 08:40.390
you'll see that I have Internet access so that's it.

08:40.410 --> 08:44.690
That shows how to install clinics as a virtual machine.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.370
Don't be intimidated by this new operating system.

08:47.370 --> 08:50.060
We're going to go through the basics and we're going to use it a lot.

08:50.310 --> 08:53.770
And it's actually going to become very easy for you to use.

08:53.820 --> 09:00.260
Also like I said you won't lose any functionality when you install color Linux as a virtual machine

09:00.270 --> 09:05.730
it's actually better to install it as a virtual machine because it's completely isolated from your computer

09:06.060 --> 09:09.770
and it'll be very easy to fix if things go wrong.

09:09.780 --> 09:15.180
Keep in mind installing this on different hardware in different computers might show you some errors

09:15.180 --> 09:20.490
on some issues so please if you have any errors just add them in the discussions and I'll help you resolve

09:20.490 --> 09:20.730
them.

09:23.240 --> 09:30.440
One more thing if Carly feels too slow or laggy then please try giving it a few minutes.

09:30.440 --> 09:37.350
Because usually when you start Carly it automatically starts checking for updates.

09:37.370 --> 09:43.290
This uses quite a bit of resources which would slow down the whole system.

09:43.500 --> 09:51.690
Also it goes without saying if your computer is not very powerful then you should close any unused applications

09:51.930 --> 09:56.340
before starting Carly to free up some resources.

09:56.550 --> 10:03.240
But as you can see and as you'll see throughout the course I'm using it with two gigs of ram to use

10:03.510 --> 10:11.280
and it's running very very smoothly and like I said You can even get away with one gigabyte of RAM and

10:11.280 --> 10:12.420
once sleepy you.

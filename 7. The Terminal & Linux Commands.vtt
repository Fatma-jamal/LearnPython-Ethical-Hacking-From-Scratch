WEBVTT

00:01.190 --> 00:07.130
Okay now that we had a quick overview of colonics I want to spend some time talking about the Linux

00:07.130 --> 00:13.310
terminal so you can access the terminals through this application right here so if you click on that

00:13.700 --> 00:15.960
it'll open the terminal window for us.

00:16.250 --> 00:21.730
And as you can see all it is is a black screen where you can type commands.

00:22.100 --> 00:28.490
Now the Linux terminal is actually very very powerful because it can be used to do anything that you

00:28.490 --> 00:30.040
can think of really.

00:30.320 --> 00:36.800
A lot of the applications in Linux that have a graphical interface where command prompt programs first

00:37.100 --> 00:40.670
and then people made a graphical interface for it.

00:40.700 --> 00:46.520
So a lot of the time maybe the graphical interface will be buggy or crash and the terminal program will

00:46.520 --> 00:48.380
still work.

00:48.380 --> 00:53.870
Also a lot of the penetration testing tools do not even have a graphical interface.

00:53.990 --> 00:58.430
A lot of them can only be used throughout the terminal.

00:58.430 --> 01:06.230
Not only that but in many scenarios you might only have an S-sh or a command prompt access to a machine.

01:06.440 --> 01:12.260
So you need to know how to use this command prompt in order to achieve your goals.

01:12.290 --> 01:15.900
So throughout the course we're going to be using the terminal a lot.

01:16.010 --> 01:22.250
And that's why I want to spend some time just showing you the basics of it and making sure that you're

01:22.250 --> 01:25.200
going to be comfortable using it.

01:25.280 --> 01:31.480
Now the basic idea is you type a command and the result will be displayed for you on screen.

01:31.970 --> 01:37.120
So let's have a look on a very very simple command which is p w d.

01:37.730 --> 01:43.260
Now this command prints the current working directory has the name P.W..

01:43.640 --> 01:50.660
So if I hit enter you can see it's print and forward slash route which means right now I'm in the root

01:50.750 --> 01:51.720
directory.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.480
So basically I'm in here this is the route.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.450
It's home.

01:57.560 --> 02:04.370
So if I do ls which is a command to list all the directories and files in the current working directory

02:04.700 --> 02:08.260
we should get all of these directories that we've seen here.

02:09.490 --> 02:16.540
So if I had to enter as you can see I can see all these directories in the current working directory.

02:17.140 --> 02:25.680
Now another very useful command is DCD command this command allow us to navigate into another directory.

02:25.690 --> 02:29.950
So for example let's say I want to navigate into the downloads.

02:30.520 --> 02:37.680
All we have to do is type C followed by the name of the directory that I want to navigate to.

02:37.690 --> 02:45.670
So I'm going to type downloads now if I hit enter I should be inside the downloads now.

02:45.780 --> 02:52.410
So if I do PWT to see my current working directory you'll see that it's saying I'm in route forward

02:52.410 --> 03:00.330
slash downloads so if I do ls here it should show me all the directories and files inside downloads.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.720
So if I do enter as you can see I have a directory and the file in here.

03:05.940 --> 03:10.560
And these are the exact same files that you'll see if you double click the downloads here.

03:12.690 --> 03:15.480
Now if you want to go back one directory.

03:15.510 --> 03:19.280
So similar to press and the back button in here.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.020
All you have to do is do a CD.

03:21.060 --> 03:26.390
Again the command to change the working directory followed by dot dot.

03:26.730 --> 03:34.170
And now if I do PWT you'll see I'm back in road and if I do ls you'll see all the directories and files

03:34.170 --> 03:35.870
and root.

03:36.030 --> 03:38.060
So that's all good.

03:38.060 --> 03:41.970
And there's actually a huge number of commands that you can use.

03:41.970 --> 03:47.940
So I'm going to include a link in the resources of the structure of all the Linux commands that you

03:47.940 --> 03:49.070
can use.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.880
You don't need to know them by heart.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.500
We're actually going to be using a lot of them throughout the course.

03:53.640 --> 03:58.770
So you're going to naturally learn them as you go through the course.

03:59.040 --> 04:04.830
Now if you are using a command and you're not sure about how this command works you can just use the

04:04.830 --> 04:09.190
man command to display the manual of this command.

04:09.660 --> 04:14.610
For example we've used the ls command here to list the files and directories in the current working

04:14.610 --> 04:15.650
directory.

04:15.780 --> 04:23.510
But if I do mine followed by LS This basically means I'm requesting the manual of ls.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.980
So I'm asking how can I use the ls command.

04:27.180 --> 04:34.650
So if I hit Enter you'll see I'll get a screen similar to a text file and basically it's given me a

04:34.650 --> 04:38.570
lot of information on how to use the ls command.

04:38.850 --> 04:43.930
So you can see that it's telling us that this command will list the directory contents.

04:44.010 --> 04:49.650
You can see the way it works by type in LS followed by the options followed by a file if you if you

04:49.650 --> 04:59.500
want to run it on a file you can see a longer description of the command and then you can see all the

04:59.500 --> 05:06.310
options and the arguments that we can use with this command now in Linux.

05:06.310 --> 05:10.420
Most of the time the options will always follow the same syntax.

05:10.570 --> 05:18.790
So either use dush letter or dash dash a word to specify the argument for example and here the dash

05:18.880 --> 05:25.230
A and dash dash all will ignore entries starting with dot.

05:25.240 --> 05:32.220
So if you keep going down in here you'll see all the options and arguments you can use with the ls command

05:33.540 --> 05:35.370
and we have another example.

05:35.370 --> 05:42.340
Here we have the dash L which means it's going to use a long listing format which will display more

05:42.340 --> 05:46.870
information about the files in the current working directory.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.140
So let's have a look on that.

05:48.160 --> 05:53.410
I'm going to press Q to exit this and then we're going to do ls as usual.

05:53.590 --> 06:00.070
And since we read the manual we know we can do dash L to see more information about the files.

06:00.280 --> 06:06.070
And if I hit Enter now you can see I'm still getting the same directories but it's also shown me the

06:06.070 --> 06:11.270
permissions of the users that they've created and so on.

06:11.290 --> 06:14.830
So you can use the man command on any command you want.

06:14.830 --> 06:16.420
Not only on the LS.

06:16.570 --> 06:24.520
So you can use it on the PWT you can use it on the CD or any other command and it'll show you full description

06:24.550 --> 06:30.210
or the manual page of how to use this command.

06:30.210 --> 06:34.830
Now I'm going to clear the screen by typing clear.

06:35.170 --> 06:38.950
And the next thing that I want to show you is the dash dash help.

06:38.950 --> 06:45.460
So this is something that you can use again and almost all commands and all programs in Linux so you

06:45.460 --> 06:53.950
can just type the program name or the command name followed by Didache help as you might think this

06:53.950 --> 06:59.440
will show you help message telling you what this command is or what this program is.

06:59.530 --> 07:06.270
The arguments that it takes how to use these arguments aren't examples at the bottom.

07:06.440 --> 07:11.340
Now another useful thing with the term and also I'm going to clear this again is the arrows.

07:11.420 --> 07:16.550
So you can press up to go up to see all the commands that we executed before.

07:16.580 --> 07:23.430
And again you can go down to see to navigate between the commands that you executed previously.

07:23.720 --> 07:27.310
You can also use the tab for auto complete.

07:27.320 --> 07:34.520
So again let's do ls and you can see all the files and let's say we want to go into documents so we

07:34.520 --> 07:37.170
can do cd followed by documents.

07:37.250 --> 07:44.650
You can type documents or if you're lazy like me you can just do d o c and press tab.

07:44.840 --> 07:49.820
And as you can see it's automatically completing the rest of the work for me.

07:50.600 --> 07:57.010
So this is something that comes very very handy when you're using the terminal for a long time.

07:57.050 --> 08:03.220
Now what I also want to show you is how to install programs and Cali from the terminal.

08:03.230 --> 08:08.790
So first I'm going to clear this and the first thing that you want to do is update the sources where

08:08.790 --> 08:13.270
Akali can search and download programs from.

08:13.280 --> 08:21.990
So we're going to do apt get update now up get is the name of the application that allows us to download

08:22.080 --> 08:23.710
and install programs.

08:23.880 --> 08:29.790
And we're saying update because I'm saying that I want you to update the list of all the programs that

08:29.850 --> 08:33.230
I can install so I'm going to hit enter.

08:33.540 --> 08:37.380
And you want to make sure that you have internet connection when running this.

08:37.530 --> 08:44.750
And as you can see it's telling me that it's done and now we can go ahead and start and stolen applications.

08:45.240 --> 08:51.890
So the first program that I want to install is actually a terminal program so similar to this one but

08:52.020 --> 08:57.740
it allows us to have multiple terminal windows open and the same window.

08:58.290 --> 09:04.740
So in order to install a program through the command line we're going to do apt get which is again the

09:04.740 --> 09:09.580
name of the program that allows us to install programs on the system.

09:09.690 --> 09:16.640
We're going to say that I want to install and the program that I want to install is called Terminator

09:18.620 --> 09:20.210
so very very simple.

09:20.270 --> 09:23.960
First of all we're type in the name of the command which is apt get.

09:24.200 --> 09:30.570
We're saying that I want to install and the program name that I want to install is called Terminator.

09:30.950 --> 09:32.160
So I'm going to hit enter.

09:33.910 --> 09:38.320
And this is going to download and install Terminator for me.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.040
So you can use the same command to install any programs that you want.

09:42.070 --> 09:48.490
You just need to replace Terminator with the name of the program that you want to install now.

09:48.500 --> 09:54.860
I've already downloaded and installed this before so it didn't ask me to confirm but if you're running

09:54.860 --> 10:00.530
this for the first time it might ask you to confirm whether or not you actually want to install this

10:00.530 --> 10:01.260
program.

10:01.430 --> 10:06.220
So all you have to do is press y from the keyboard and hit enter.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.040
Now as you can see it's done.

10:08.260 --> 10:17.640
So if I go to my all applications in here and just type Terminator you can see that I have it here.

10:18.160 --> 10:24.950
So I'm actually going to drag it and put it in my dark so I can access it easily in the future.

10:26.780 --> 10:32.510
So now I can just click it in here and that will open Terminator for me.

10:32.510 --> 10:36.320
Now this is another application that allow me to run commands.

10:36.350 --> 10:38.980
So it's exactly the same as this.

10:38.990 --> 10:47.180
So again I can do ls and P.W. D The only difference is with this one I can actually right click and

10:47.180 --> 10:54.230
click on split horizontally for example and this will split the same screen into two screens where I

10:54.230 --> 11:01.190
can run commands at the same time so I can have some commands in here and I can run commands in here.

11:02.380 --> 11:08.220
And then I can even split this more if I want again vertically or horizontally.

11:08.730 --> 11:14.530
And as you can see I can have as many terminal windows as I want and this will be very helpful in the

11:14.530 --> 11:20.300
future when we'll be running a number of programs and a number of commands at the same time.

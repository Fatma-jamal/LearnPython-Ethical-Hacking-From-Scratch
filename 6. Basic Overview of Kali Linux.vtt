00:01.160 --> 00:07.940
Okay now that we have Linux installed I want to give you a basic overview of this operating system and

00:07.940 --> 00:12.650
the structure so that you're comfortable with it and we're going to be using it throughout the whole

00:12.650 --> 00:13.310
course.

00:13.310 --> 00:18.310
So everything is going to become easier for you as we go through the course.

00:18.670 --> 00:22.270
Now the first thing that I want to talk about is the status bar in here.

00:22.660 --> 00:26.150
So you can see we have an applications menu in here.

00:26.520 --> 00:31.490
And inside it you can see all the applications are categorized.

00:31.570 --> 00:38.500
So we have information gathering applications vulnerability analysis web application analysis reverse

00:38.530 --> 00:41.010
engineering and so on.

00:41.500 --> 00:46.950
So you can go on each one of these entries and just select any programs that you want to run.

00:47.620 --> 00:54.190
And the next menus that we have is the places which shows you the most common places in the file system.

00:54.550 --> 00:59.760
So we have home we have the desktop we have the documents downloads and so on.

00:59.800 --> 01:05.200
So you can access the places from here and then you click on home or you can just click on the files

01:05.260 --> 01:11.710
icon in here at the left and both of these will bring you to the home directory which is actually the

01:11.710 --> 01:13.120
root directory.

01:13.150 --> 01:15.350
So it says home in here.

01:15.490 --> 01:22.520
But the actual location of this if I do control l you'll see it is forward slash route.

01:23.140 --> 01:28.750
So inside this you can see we have our downloads music pictures similar to the way that you have it

01:28.750 --> 01:31.550
in Windows and OSX.

01:31.570 --> 01:36.700
We also have the time in here and in here on the right we have more controls.

01:36.910 --> 01:40.810
So the first thing that we have in here is the workspaces.

01:40.810 --> 01:45.160
So Linux comes with multiple workspaces by default.

01:45.190 --> 01:51.250
Basically what this allows us to do is we can have this desktop in here for example we can open the

01:51.250 --> 01:56.360
places and we can for example navigate to downloads and do some work in here.

01:56.890 --> 02:04.690
But if we go here to work places and go to the second one you can see that I have an empty desktop that

02:04.690 --> 02:08.990
I can do whatever I want and for example I can launch Firefox in here.

02:10.690 --> 02:16.780
And then again if I want to go back to the first workspace all I have to do is click on here click on

02:16.780 --> 02:19.150
number one and I'm back in here.

02:20.260 --> 02:26.740
And because I've already used up two spaces the system is already creating a third empty space so I

02:26.740 --> 02:27.790
can click on that.

02:27.820 --> 02:31.640
And as you can see I'm in the third space where I can do more stuff.

02:32.930 --> 02:40.880
Now you can also navigate between the spaces by pressing control alt up or down to go up and down in

02:40.880 --> 02:46.310
the spaces the next part of the saddest part is this last part in here.

02:46.790 --> 02:51.880
And if you click on it basically the first thing it'll allow you to do is control the sound.

02:51.890 --> 02:54.500
Next you'll see your connections.

02:54.500 --> 02:59.690
So as you can see right now and as I showed you before this is showing up as if we're connected to a

02:59.690 --> 03:07.820
wired network because I configured this network to use that network if you have a wireless adapter connected

03:07.820 --> 03:10.970
to this computer you should be able to see it here.

03:11.240 --> 03:17.510
If you don't see it then follow the link in the resources of the sector to see how to properly connect

03:17.510 --> 03:23.420
your wireless adapter or any device to a virtual machine.

03:23.420 --> 03:31.770
Now I should note you can only use external us be adapters in order to access Wi-Fi networks from Kaleem.

03:31.820 --> 03:38.930
You cannot use the built in Wi-Fi card but Kelly should have Internet connection anyway because it is

03:38.930 --> 03:40.820
configured to use and not network.

03:40.910 --> 03:44.770
And as you can see in here it's still me my wired is connected.

03:45.140 --> 03:55.150
So if I actually go down to Firefox I'll close this and if I just go to Google that come you can see

03:55.240 --> 03:57.980
it is connected to the Internet.

03:58.030 --> 04:02.010
So let's go back to where we were.

04:02.050 --> 04:08.710
If we click here we also have the battery settings the user settings.

04:08.710 --> 04:11.180
You have this button to turn off the machine.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.150
This is to lock the machine.

04:13.150 --> 04:19.030
And this will show the preferences where you can modify the preferences of the machine so you have Bluetooth

04:19.030 --> 04:24.290
Wi-Fi change the background change the languages and so on.

04:24.700 --> 04:30.100
So you can spend some time getting familiar with this it's very easy and very intuitive.

04:30.100 --> 04:35.740
Same goes to the file manager and we're very intuitive DoubleClick to go when you can right click and

04:35.770 --> 04:41.500
archive and extract here to uncompress said you can navigate through all of these files by clicking

04:41.500 --> 04:45.660
them and then you have the tri shear which contains the deleted files.

04:47.420 --> 04:54.770
Now we also have the dock in here which contains the favorite applications and you can also access all

04:54.770 --> 04:58.820
the other applications by clicking on this icon right here.

04:58.830 --> 05:04.370
The show applications and this will show you a menu with the most frequent applications.

05:04.610 --> 05:09.410
And then if you click on all it will show you all the available applications.

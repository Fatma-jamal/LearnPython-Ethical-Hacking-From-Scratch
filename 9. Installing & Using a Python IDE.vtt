00:01.170 --> 00:07.950
OK so in the previous lecture we've seen how we can write very simple code in a normal text editor saved

00:07.980 --> 00:14.490
as the file and that file will work normally and the code will get executed.

00:14.490 --> 00:21.690
Now you can actually use a text editor to write even more complex Python programs as the program gets

00:21.690 --> 00:22.830
bigger.

00:22.830 --> 00:28.670
It becomes more challenging to just use a normal or simple text editor.

00:28.680 --> 00:36.780
There are programs that are specifically made to help you with programming testing refactoring and so

00:36.780 --> 00:38.060
on.

00:38.130 --> 00:44.730
These are commonly known as ID is or integrated development environment.

00:45.180 --> 00:50.970
So the program that we're going to use to write Python programs throughout the whole Course is called

00:51.000 --> 00:52.330
pie chart.

00:52.860 --> 00:58.640
Now I'm going to include the download link for this program into resources of this lecture.

00:58.860 --> 01:00.500
But I have it in here.

01:00.790 --> 01:03.060
And the professional version is paid.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.820
So we're going to be using the community version and it's perfect.

01:06.810 --> 01:09.680
You don't really need the professional anyway.

01:10.230 --> 01:15.070
So if you click on the download the download will automatically start.

01:15.420 --> 01:21.810
Now I'm actually going to cancel it because I've already downloaded it and when you downloaded it's

01:21.810 --> 01:29.460
going to go in your downloads directory so you can click on this in here or you can just go to your

01:29.460 --> 01:34.530
files in here and then go to downloads.

01:34.710 --> 01:38.520
And as you can see I have it downloaded in here.

01:38.550 --> 01:40.150
Now this is compressed.

01:40.320 --> 01:48.500
So in order to uncompress this archive and go to right click it and click on extract here.

01:48.780 --> 01:54.540
Now right here I have the directory for the program and you can leave it in downloads and use it from

01:54.540 --> 01:55.230
here.

01:55.380 --> 02:00.300
But I like to put the optional programs in the opiated directory.

02:00.300 --> 02:05.670
This is the directory that you're supposed to put all the optional programs.

02:05.850 --> 02:13.650
So I'm going to right click this and copy it and then I am going to press control L to open the path

02:13.650 --> 02:21.840
bar and here as you can see I'm going to put forward slash or P-T to go to the opiated directory and

02:21.900 --> 02:24.070
I'll go to pasted in here.

02:25.380 --> 02:33.420
Now inside the church directory We have a bin directory and inside this directory We have a file called

02:33.450 --> 02:34.570
pi charme thought.

02:34.610 --> 02:42.400
SH This is the file that will run the program for us.

02:42.420 --> 02:50.380
So now in order to run this we have to go to terminal and we have to navigate to where this file is.

02:50.550 --> 02:59.130
So we're going to use the cd command and it's in our P-T pie chart and you can use the tab to auto complete

02:59.210 --> 03:08.060
as you can see and then now if we're listed here you'll see the same files that we see here and the

03:08.060 --> 03:12.450
ones that we want to run is a charm that sh.

03:12.470 --> 03:20.000
Now in order to run an executable in Linux all we have to do is put that forward slash followed by the

03:20.000 --> 03:25.440
name of the executable which is Pi charmed that sh.

03:25.500 --> 03:34.100
Now if I hit Enter you'll see the program is going to start loading and you'll see the welcome message

03:34.160 --> 03:35.740
of the program.

03:35.840 --> 03:41.810
Now I've actually run this before so I didn't get all the initial configurations.

03:41.870 --> 03:46.710
So when you ran it for the first time it's going to ask you which theme you want to use.

03:46.940 --> 03:49.960
I think to use the dark theme as you can see here.

03:50.150 --> 03:54.150
And then I kept everything else as the default.

03:54.410 --> 03:59.250
So let's go ahead and create a new project by clicking on this in here.

04:00.650 --> 04:05.600
And as you can see it's asking us for the location for the project.

04:05.660 --> 04:13.280
So by default by chance puts projects in route and in a directory called pi Chown projects.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.070
So leave all of this the same.

04:15.230 --> 04:21.340
And the only part you want to modify is the name of the project which is set to Untitled right now.

04:21.530 --> 04:23.960
And we're going to set it to Hello.

04:25.020 --> 04:33.020
I'm going to click on create this will create a project and open up the editor window for me.

04:34.770 --> 04:41.430
So right here on the left we have the tree that shows the external libraries and we'll talk about what

04:41.430 --> 04:45.530
that is later on on the path for our project.

04:45.540 --> 04:51.990
So right now you can see that this project in our home directory followed by pi Chan projects followed

04:51.990 --> 04:53.100
by Halo.

04:53.130 --> 04:55.040
So this is the name of the directory.

04:55.320 --> 04:59.580
And inside it as you can see we have no files.

04:59.580 --> 05:06.090
So if I actually go to my file manager and if we just go to this location.

05:06.090 --> 05:13.710
So if we go to route which is home you can see we have a new directory called pi Chan project.

05:13.710 --> 05:21.200
So in the future I'm always going to put all the programs and projects that we make inside this directory.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.600
Inside it you can see the hello project that we just created.

05:26.130 --> 05:27.590
And inside that there is nothing.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.090
There is no files.

05:29.640 --> 05:36.810
So we're going to create a new file by right click on this and go on you and we're going to create a

05:36.810 --> 05:42.170
python file and it's asking us for the name of the file.

05:42.270 --> 05:44.190
So let's call it hello.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.440
That's why similar to what we did before.

05:48.570 --> 05:50.620
I'm going to click on OK.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.650
And as you can see now we have a new file here.

05:53.880 --> 06:01.060
And again if we go back to the path you can see we have a new file called Python that Pyu II now and

06:01.070 --> 06:07.230
here we can actually put any code that we want to write and we're going to start by in the shebang.

06:07.460 --> 06:17.460
So it's us our Bean and Python and then we're going to start type in our program and we're going to

06:17.460 --> 06:20.280
write a similar program to the previous lecture.

06:20.310 --> 06:25.960
The whole point of this lecture is to show you how to install and use pi cherub not to write a program.

06:26.190 --> 06:33.390
So I'm just going to do print and as you can see as soon as I type print it's automatically showing

06:33.390 --> 06:37.490
me the function and it's showing me how this function can be used.

06:37.500 --> 06:43.590
So it takes I should open a bracket and inside the bracket as you can see now it's Tell me the values

06:43.590 --> 06:48.290
that I can put and similar to what we've seen in the previous lecture.

06:48.300 --> 06:55.380
We're going to put two quotation marks to enclose our message that we want to display and we want to

06:55.380 --> 06:59.520
display Hello world.

06:59.550 --> 07:05.850
Now you can see it's also used in different colors for different parts of the text so you can see the

07:05.850 --> 07:11.940
function name is in blue and you can see the message that I'm displaying in green.

07:11.940 --> 07:19.520
Now this message is being displayed in green because what's in here is known as a string and Python.

07:19.860 --> 07:27.960
So any sequence of characters enclosed by two quotation marks is known as a strain and we'll see what

07:27.960 --> 07:33.660
strings are and how to deal with them more actually much more throughout the course.

07:33.660 --> 07:39.810
So right now this is done and we can actually run this code from within this project.

07:39.810 --> 07:46.770
So all we have to do we can just go to run and click on the run here and we're going to tell it we want

07:46.770 --> 07:48.600
to run the Hello.

07:49.080 --> 07:53.610
And as you can see it Ronit for me and it's shown me the message in here.

07:54.330 --> 07:56.720
But I actually don't like to do that.

07:56.730 --> 08:02.760
I like to run the file from terminal and that's why I spent a lot of time showing you where the files

08:02.760 --> 08:06.150
are going to be stored so that you know where to navigate.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.110
Where do you want to run the file.

08:08.610 --> 08:15.530
So let's go back to our terminal and I'm going to split the screen so I'm going right click and split

08:15.560 --> 08:24.440
horizontally and if we want to run this file right here from the terminal then what we need to do is

08:24.440 --> 08:28.600
navigate to the location where this file is stored.

08:29.270 --> 08:37.600
And if you remember when we created this project we set this project to be stored in home Python projects.

08:37.730 --> 08:38.680
Hello.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.670
So we have to navigate to that location.

08:42.020 --> 08:48.370
So I'm going to do cd root which is home followed by Python projects.

08:48.380 --> 08:54.270
Again you can use the top to autocomplete and the name of my project is hello.

08:54.800 --> 09:02.150
Now if I do ls here you'll see I have the file here and again in order to run this file we can just

09:02.150 --> 09:04.540
do a python Hello.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.830
Why and this will execute the file for me.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.130
So that's it for this lecture.

09:11.260 --> 09:14.060
I just wanted to show you how to install PI charm.

09:14.110 --> 09:19.830
Create a project and run the code into project from pie chart and from the terminal.

09:20.020 --> 09:26.440
So that in the future when I create a new project or run the code I will not cover this or I might be

09:26.440 --> 09:31.510
doing this quickly because I've already covered how to do this in this lecture.

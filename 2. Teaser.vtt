00:00.880 --> 00:07.390
Now before we dive into the course content I'd like to give you a teaser or a taste of what you'll be

00:07.390 --> 00:10.910
able to do by the end of the course.

00:11.080 --> 00:18.160
Now usually in my teens or lectures I'll give one example to show students what they'll be able to do

00:18.250 --> 00:19.870
once done with the course.

00:20.110 --> 00:26.760
But in this course you're going to learn so many cool things and we're going to build more than 20 hacking

00:26.770 --> 00:27.610
tools.

00:27.730 --> 00:32.690
So it's unfair and it's really hard for me to pick only one example.

00:33.710 --> 00:41.480
Therefore instead I'm going to show you three examples taken from the three main sections of the course.

00:41.510 --> 00:47.340
Now keep in mind each one of these sections is divided into a number of subsections.

00:47.510 --> 00:53.730
So these examples are only a small fraction of what you'll be able to do once done with the course.

00:53.900 --> 01:01.610
But I think they work really well to give you a taste of what you'll be able to achieve once done.

01:01.610 --> 01:03.950
Now since this is just a teaser.

01:03.950 --> 01:06.570
Don't worry about how these programs work.

01:06.620 --> 01:10.800
We will cover how to write these programs in details.

01:10.820 --> 01:15.030
So for now just sit back watch the lecture and enjoy it.

01:15.170 --> 01:19.670
And then once you start the course you will learn how to write all of these programs.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.610
And much much more.

01:22.840 --> 01:31.060
And the first example I'm going to use two programs the first one will allow us to intercept data sent

01:31.120 --> 01:35.340
or received by any computer on the same network.

01:36.400 --> 01:43.540
The second one will read this data and filter it to show us user names passwords visited you are elves

01:43.880 --> 01:44.930
and so on.

01:45.040 --> 01:50.580
We're going to write these programs ourselves from scratch later on in the course.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.050
Now these programs are running on my Hocker machine.

01:55.060 --> 02:01.890
So let's go to the target machine and try to generate some traffic and maybe log in to a service.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.340
I'm going to go to hotmail dot com and let's try to sign in.

02:06.370 --> 02:11.230
So I'm going to click on seinen and I'm just going to put some sample information.

02:11.290 --> 02:17.940
So I'm going to put a user name and the sample password and I'm going to hit enter.

02:18.030 --> 02:24.600
And now if we go back to the hacker machine you can see that first of all I can see all the requests

02:24.690 --> 02:31.440
I can see on the Web sites they're visiting and I can also see the user name and the password that they

02:31.440 --> 02:32.590
logged in with.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.210
So I can see the username was 822.

02:35.220 --> 02:42.920
I taught mail dot com and I can see the password was 1 2 3 4 5 6.

02:42.940 --> 02:49.960
The second example that I'm going to show you is a back door a back door is a program that was executed

02:50.020 --> 02:51.160
on a system.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.460
It allows us to remotely control that system.

02:54.460 --> 02:58.480
So basically hack it and gain full control over it.

02:58.540 --> 03:03.850
Now just like all the other tools would go we're going to program this from scratch and I'm going to

03:03.850 --> 03:09.820
show you how to write this in a generic way so that you can use the information you learn here in many

03:09.820 --> 03:10.720
scenarios.

03:10.720 --> 03:18.480
For example you'll be able to write a web server a chat program and so one now right here I'm already

03:18.480 --> 03:24.780
at the hype machine and as you can see it's already listening and waiting for incoming connections.

03:25.350 --> 03:30.500
Once the backdoor gets executed on a computer we will get a connection.

03:30.540 --> 03:38.010
As you can see here once we have that connection we'll be able to use all the features implemented in

03:38.010 --> 03:42.150
this backdoor which we're going to implement ourselves.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.790
So first of all I have file system access.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.070
So if I do a CD it'll show me my current working directory.

03:50.250 --> 03:54.050
And as you can see I'm in users Zayd downloads.

03:54.420 --> 03:58.780
That's basically because the back door is actually stored in this location.

03:59.760 --> 04:08.280
So I can see the dot dot to go back one directory and if I do see now to see where I might be can't

04:08.340 --> 04:17.190
see I'm in zayd and we can also execute all system commands and keep in mind this Pactor works on all

04:17.190 --> 04:18.540
operating systems.

04:18.540 --> 04:25.380
It works on Linux Windows and OS X so you can use the system command of your target and they will work

04:25.380 --> 04:26.540
by default.

04:26.910 --> 04:28.800
So right now my target is Windows.

04:28.890 --> 04:32.560
So if I wanted to list the directories I can do it there.

04:32.940 --> 04:39.710
And as you can see I get a list of all the files and directories in the current working directory.

04:39.720 --> 04:47.540
Now I can go back in downloads by doing CD downloads and a file list again in here.

04:47.670 --> 04:54.360
You'll see the files that we have in the downloads which are the back door and the JTR image which I

04:54.360 --> 04:55.600
have right here.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.370
Now we also want to highlight a feature that we're going to program which is the ability to download

05:03.370 --> 05:11.660
files so I'm just going to do download and I'm going to follow it by the file name that I want to download.

05:11.780 --> 05:12.760
And it's the image.

05:12.770 --> 05:16.970
So it's G.T. or GBG.

05:17.170 --> 05:21.250
And as you can see all see it automatically being downloaded in here.

05:21.430 --> 05:29.100
And if we double click this we have the image intact and we're able to open it now I'm downloading the

05:29.100 --> 05:35.400
image just as an example but it just goes to show you that you'll be able to download any files from

05:35.400 --> 05:36.570
the target system.

05:37.790 --> 05:43.370
You can also upload files which is really really useful because you'll be able to upload evil files

05:43.370 --> 05:45.990
viruses kill ogres and so on.

05:46.280 --> 05:53.140
And as an example I'm just going to rename this image to G.T. are to the AJP you.

05:53.470 --> 06:02.610
I am going to upload it so I'm going to do upload G.T. or two dot JP G.

06:04.480 --> 06:11.930
Now tell me the upload is successful and if we go here again you can see we have the new image.

06:12.230 --> 06:18.020
Now if this was an evil file because you're able to execute system commands from the back door you'll

06:18.020 --> 06:23.780
be able to just call it from here and execute it remotely on the target computer.

06:25.260 --> 06:30.250
The last example that I want to show you is a vulnerability scanner.

06:30.280 --> 06:36.970
This is a program that can automatically discover weaknesses in Web sites and web applications.

06:36.970 --> 06:43.600
So all you have to do is just give this program a website and first of all it's going to discover all

06:43.600 --> 06:47.530
the links and all the pages in the target website.

06:47.740 --> 06:55.240
Then for each one of these pages it's going to extract all the parameters and all the forms.

06:55.270 --> 07:03.920
And finally for each one of these parameters and forms it's going to submit code to discover vulnerabilities.

07:03.970 --> 07:07.840
Then once it's done it's going to show me the results.

07:07.930 --> 07:15.310
And as you can see it was able to discover an s s s vulnerability in here just like all the other programs

07:15.470 --> 07:19.050
were going to write this from scratch ourselves.

07:19.210 --> 07:24.460
So again don't worry about how this works and don't worry if you don't understand what the vulnerability

07:24.550 --> 07:29.130
is and all of that we will cover all of this later on in the course.
